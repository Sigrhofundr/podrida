# 🎴 Game Rules: Podrida

## Introduction

**Podrida** is a strategic card game based on predictions, similar to Whist and Oh Hell. The goal is to predict exactly how many tricks you'll take in each round.

---

## 🎯 Game Objective

Achieve the **highest score** by accurately predicting the number of tricks you will take in each round.

---

## 🃏 Setup

### Deck Selection
- **40-card deck**: Italian or Spanish cards (Coins, Swords, Cups, Clubs)
- **52-card deck**: French cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)

### Number of Players
- From **2 to 40 players** (ideal 4-8 players)

### Dealer
- One player is chosen as the **first dealer**
- The role rotates clockwise each round

---

## 📋 Game Structure

The game is divided into **rounds** with a variable number of cards:

1. **Going Up**: Start from 1 card, go up to the maximum possible
2. **Going Down**: Go down from maximum to 1 card
3. **BLIND Final Round**: 1 card played on the forehead

### Example (5 players, 40-card deck):
- Rounds 1-8: from 1 to 8 cards (going up)
- Rounds 9-15: from 7 to 1 card (going down)
- Round 16: 1 BLIND card (finale)

> The maximum number of cards per round depends on the total available divided by the number of players

## 🎮 How to Play

Each round is divided into **two phases**:

### 1️⃣ Bidding Phase

In turn, **starting with the player after the dealer**, each player declares how many tricks they think they'll take.

**Important Rule - Dealer Restriction:**
- The **dealer bids last**
- **CANNOT bid** a number that would make the total sum equal to the number of cards in play
- This ensures someone will miss their prediction!

**Example** (Round with 3 cards, 4 players):
- Player 1: bids 1
- Player 2: bids 0
- Player 3: bids 1
- **Dealer**: CANNOT bid 1 (because 1+0+1+1=3), must bid 0 or 2+

### 2️⃣ Playing Phase

The round is played normally:
- Each player plays a card
- **Card value order** (40-card deck): 1 (Ace) > 3 > 10 (King) > 9 (Knight) > 8 (Jack) > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 2
- The **highest card of the led suit** wins the trick (the first suit played)
- **In case of a tie**, the stronger suit wins: **Coins > Swords > Cups > Clubs**
  - Example: Ace of Swords beats Ace of Clubs
- Whoever wins the trick leads the next round

### 🎭 BLIND Final Round

In the last round (1 card) it's played in a special way:
1. Each player receives 1 face-down card
2. **WITHOUT looking at it**, when the signal is given, everyone puts the card **on their forehead** facing the others
3. Now each player **sees others' cards but not their own**
4. In turn, each player makes their bid (0 or 1) based on the cards they see
5. Only after everyone has bid, the cards are played normally
6. Adds suspense and strategy: you must deduce your card from the others!

---

## 💯 Scoring

The calculation is simple and automatic:

### If you predict exactly:
```
Points = 10 (base) + (tricks taken × 3)
```

**Examples:**
- Bid 0, took 0 → **10 points** (10 + 0×3)
- Bid 2, took 2 → **16 points** (10 + 2×3)
- Bid 5, took 5 → **25 points** (10 + 5×3)

### If you're wrong:
```
Points = 0
```

## 🏆 End Game and Winner

The game ends after the BLIND round.

**The winner** is whoever has the **highest total score** from all rounds combined.

In case of a tie, the winner is whoever made more correct predictions during the game.

---

## 💡 Strategic Tips

1. **Check your hand**: Realistically evaluate your cards before bidding
2. **Watch the dealer**: Remember the dealer cannot make certain bids
3. **Memory**: Keep track of played cards to better predict subsequent tricks
4. **Balance**: Sometimes it's better to bid 0 if you have a weak hand
5. **BLIND round**: It requires deduction based on what you see!

## 🎲 Variants

### Variant with Trump
Some versions include a **random trump** each round:
- A card is revealed from the deck
- That suit becomes trump (always beats normal suits)

> The app currently supports the version **without trump**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What happens if everyone is wrong?**  
A: Nobody scores points in that round.

**Q: Can I bid 0?**  
A: Yes! Bidding 0 and taking no tricks is worth 10 points.

**Q: Is the dealer disadvantaged?**  
A: Yes and no. They cannot make certain bids, but they bid last and have more information.

**Q: What if I bid 3 but take 2?**  
A: You get 0 points. You must predict **exactly**.
